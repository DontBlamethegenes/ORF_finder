# Vanilla Python Gene finder
By Alberto Aldapa


## Problem: 
Finding all the possible genes in a genome can take a very long time if done incorrectly. Regular expressions fail at edge cases and don't allow for useful user specifed parameters such as minimum length of 
ORF.

## Solution:
A class built using only vanilla python with no required packages. This class needs to emply an advanced algorythm capable of searching the entire genome quickly and effectivly.
## Techniques:
## Results:
